Code and tools used to estimate freshwater fluxes from data using linear response theory. 


The tools folder contains functions needed for applying the method including functions for fitting the Gaussian mixture model, regridding data, and applying linear response theory. The folder model_tests applies the method to data from the CESM large ensemble. Here we focus on historical time period (1975-2019), but the folder also includes tests for future times (2011-2050). The folder app_to_obs applies the method to IAP data (see Cheng et al. 2020).
